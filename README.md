# Traffic Sign Classification

This repository containing both OpenCV and a Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used to train and validate 
a model that can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset]
(http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) for project 2 of the [Self-Driving Car Nanodegree 
program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) by Udacity.

The Udacity project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project).

## Prerequisites

The code is located in a Jupyter Notebook. You can install Jupyter Notebook by installing 
[Anaconda](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda) or with pip

``` pip3 install jupyter ```

## Installing

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Heych88/udacity-sdcnd-traffic-sign-classification.git
```

## Running the Code

Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`

```
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```

## Usage

This repository provides an introduction into the Tensorflow implementation of CNN's and OpenCV.
